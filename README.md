# wholetmydaWgout

Our team has created a nice tool for any dog-owner. Its perfect for looking up local resources for pet owners and dog walkers 🚶‍♀️.

A user can visit this website and type in the name of a city and choose what type of resource they are interested in. Once the user presses submit, an interactive Google Maps window will appear on screen to show the selected resources that are near the requested city. For those who are thinking about taking their dog for a walk, a box displaying the weather will appear to let you know what its like outside currently at that location.


As of this release;

🐶 The map element is restriced to City only. However in future releases, it wil be searchable by address.

🐶 There are four options for query: Pet Training, Veterinarian, Pet Stores, nearby Parks. These options will be expanded as well in a future release.

🐶 The current radius is set to 500 on query.

🐶 Past searches are stored in local storage and printed on the page. In future releases they will be interactable.

Website Tech: Jquery, Foundation, OpenWeatherAPI, GoogleMapsAPI, Moment.js, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome.
